Problem:
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
	1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
	2. print: Print the list.
	3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
	4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
	5. sort: Sort the list.
	6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
	7. reverse: Reverse the list.
_Initialize your list
_Read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands
(Each command will be of the 7 types listed above) 
_Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list

Sample input:
	12
	insert 0 5
	insert 1 10
	insert 0 6
	print
	remove 6
	append 9
	append 1
	sort
	print
	pop
	reverse
	print

Sample output:
	[6, 5, 10]
	[1, 5, 9, 10]
	[9, 5, 1]
