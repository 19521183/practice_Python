Problem:
	Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
		1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
		2. print: Print the list.
		3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
		4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
		5. sort: Sort the list.
		6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
		7. reverse: Reverse the list.
	_Initialize your list
	_Read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands. (Each command will be of the 7 types listed above) 
	_Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list

Input format:
	_The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of commands
	_Each line of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above

Constraints: 
	The elements added to the list must be integers.


Sample Input:
	12
	insert 0 5
